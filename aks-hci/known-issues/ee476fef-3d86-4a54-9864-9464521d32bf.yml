  kubectl logs return "error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials)" 
"Description" : |
  There is an issue with AKS hybrid in which a cluster can stop returning logs. When this happens, running `kubectl logs <pod_name>` returns "error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials)". AKS hybrid rotates core Kubernetes certificates every 4 days, but sometimes the Kubernetes API server doesn't immediately reload its client certificate for communication with kubelet when the certificates update.
"Fix" : |
  To mitigate the issue, there are several options:

  1. Rerun `kubectl logs`. For example, run the following PowerShell command:
  
     ```powershell
     while (1) {kubectl logs <POD_NAME>; sleep 1}
     ```
    
  1. Restart the `kube-apiserver` container on each of the control planes for a cluster. Restarting the API server does not impact running workloads. To restart the API server, follow these steps:
     1. Get the IP addresses for each control plane in your cluster:
        
        ```powershell
        kubectl get nodes -o wide
        ```

     1. Run the following command:
     
        ```powershell
        ssh -i (get-akshciconfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<CONTROL_PLANE_IP> 'sudo crictl stop $(sudo crictl ps --name kube-apiserver -o json | jq -r .containers[0].id)'
        ```

  1. Optionally, but not recommended for production workloads, you can ask `kube-apiserver` not to verify the server certificate of the kubelet:

     ```powershell
     kubectl logs <POD_NAME> --insecure-skip-tls-verify-backend=true
     ```
