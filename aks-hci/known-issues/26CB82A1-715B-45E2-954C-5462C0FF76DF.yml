"Issue" : |
  PowerShell deployment doesn't check for available memory before creating a new workload cluster
"Description" : |
  The **Aks-Hci** PowerShell commands don't validate the available memory on the host server before creating Kubernetes nodes. This issue can lead to memory exhaustion and virtual machines that don't start. 
"Fix" : |
  This failure is currently not handled gracefully, and the deployment will stop responding with no clear error message. If you have a deployment that stops responding, open Event Viewer and check for a Hyper-V-related error message indicating there's not enough memory to start the VM.
