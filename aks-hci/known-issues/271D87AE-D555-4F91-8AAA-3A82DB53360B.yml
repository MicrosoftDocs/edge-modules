  Error: 'Failed to start the cloud agent generic cluster service in failover cluster. The cluster resource group os in the 'failed' state.'
"Description" : |
  Cloud agent may fail to successfully start when using path names with spaces in them.
  
  When using [Set-AksHciConfig](./reference/ps/set-akshciconfig.md) to specify `-imageDir`, `-workingDir`, `-cloudConfigLocation`, or `-nodeConfigLocation` parameters with a path name that contains a space character, such as `D:\Cloud Share\AKS HCI`, the cloud agent cluster service will fail to start with the following (or similar) error message:

  ```
  Failed to start the cloud agent generic cluster service in failover cluster. The cluster resource group os in the 'failed' state. Resources in 'failed' or 'pending' states: 'MOC Cloud Agent Service'
  ```
"Fix" : |
  To work around this issue, use a path that does not include spaces, for example, `C:\CloudShare\AKS-HCI`.
