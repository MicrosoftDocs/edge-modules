  Attempt to increase the number of worker nodes fails.
"Description" : |
  When using PowerShell to create a cluster with static IP and then attempt to increase the number of worker nodes in the workload cluster, the installation got stuck at `control plane count at 2, still waiting for desired state: 3`. After a period of time, another error message appears: `Error: timed out waiting for the condition`.

  When [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md) was run, it showed that the control plane nodes were created and provisioned and were in a _Ready_ state. However, when `kubectl get nodes` was run, it showed that the control plane nodes had been created but not provisioned and weren't in a _Ready_ state.
"Fix" : |
  If you get this error, verify that the IP addresses have been assigned to the created nodes using either Hyper-V Manager or PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  (Get-VM |Get-VMNetworkAdapter).IPAddresses |fl
  ```
  Then, verify the network settings to ensure there are enough IP addresses left in the pool to create more VMs.
