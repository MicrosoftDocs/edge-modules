## 20 Error: `Install-Moc failed with error - Exception [Could not create the failover cluster generic role.]`  

This error indicates that the cloud service's IP address is not a part of the cluster network and doesn't match any of the cluster networks that have the `client and cluster communication` role enabled.

To resolve this issue, run [Get-ClusterNetwork](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/get-clusternetwork?view=windowsserver2019-ps&preserve-view=true) where `Role` equals `ClusterAndClient`. Then, on one of the cluster nodes, select the name, address, and address mask to verify that the IP address provided for the `-cloudServiceIP` parameter of [New-AksHciNetworkSetting](./reference/ps/new-akshcinetworksetting.md) matches one of the displayed networks.
