  An 'Unable to acquire token' error appears when running Set-AksHciRegistration.
"Description" : |
  This error can occur when you have multiple tenants on your Azure account. 
"Fix" : |
  Use `$tenantId = (Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id` to set the right tenant. Then, include this tenant as a parameter while running [Set-AksHciRegistration](./reference/ps/set-akshciregistration.md).
