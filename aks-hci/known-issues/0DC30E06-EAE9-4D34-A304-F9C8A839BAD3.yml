"Issue" : |
  When using large clusters, the Get-AksHciLogs command may fail with an exception.
"Description" : |
  With large clusters, the `Get-AksHciLogs` command may throw an exception, fail to enumerate nodes, or won't generate the c:\wssd\wssdlogs.zip output file.
"Fix" : |
  This is because the PowerShell command to zip a file, Compress-Archive, has an output file size limit of 2GB.
