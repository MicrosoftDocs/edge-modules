  Error 'Certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509'
"Description" : |
  The target cluster is not accessible when control plane certificates fail to renew. When trying to reach the cluster, the `kubectl` command displays the following error:

  `certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2022-07-26T12:24:15-04:00 is after 2022-07-15T15:01:07Z`

  > [!NOTE]  
  > This issue is fixed in the September 2022 release and later.

  ### To reproduce

  1. Install AksHci.
  2. Install target cluster.
  3. Turn off the cluster (VMs) for more than 4 days.
  4. Turn the cluster on again.

  ### Expected behavior

  The target cluster is unreachable. Any `kubectl` command run against the target cluster returns an error message similar to the following one:

  `certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2022-07-26T12:24:15-04:00 is after 2022-07-15T15:01:07Z`
 
"Fix" : |
  1. Run the following command to generate certificates manually:
     `Update-AksHciClusterCertificates  -Name my-workload-cluster -fixKubeltCredentials`
  2. Generate new credentials:
     `Get-AksHciCredential -name <clustername>`
  3. Wait a few minutes, and then try the `kubectl` command again to see whether the cluster is available.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > There is a known bug in AksHci version 1.0.14.x and earlier. If the control plane VM has a name pattern other than `-control-plane-`, the `Update-AksHciClusterCertificates` command may not work. You must update the certificate by logging into the control plane VM:
  >
  > 1. Find the IP address of the target cluster control plane VM.
  > 2. Run the following command:
  >    `ssh -i (get-mocconfig).sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip>`
  > 3. List the cert tattoo files:
  >    `sudo ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/cert-tattoo-*`
  > 4. Generate certificates using each file listed by the previous command:
  >    `sudo /usr/bin/cert-tattoo-provision CreateCertsWithAltNames <absolute-path-of-cert-tattoo-file>`
