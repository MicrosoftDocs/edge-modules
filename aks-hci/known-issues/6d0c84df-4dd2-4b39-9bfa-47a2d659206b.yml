  Cluster controlplane - certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509
"Description" : |
  The target cluster is not accessible when control plane certificates fail to renew. When trying to reach the cluster, the `kubectl` command generates the following error:

  `certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2022-07-26T12:24:15-04:00 is after 2022-07-15T15:01:07Z`
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > This issue is fixed in the September 2022 release and later.

  ### To reproduce

  1. Install AksHci.
  2. Install the target cluster.
  3. Turn off cluster(vms) for more than 4 days.
  4. Turn the cluster on again.

  ### Symptoms and mitigation

  The target cluster should be unreachable. Any `kubectl` command run against the target cluster should return with an error message similar to the following:

  `certificate expired - Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2022-07-26T12:24:15-04:00 is after 2022-07-15T15:01:07Z`
  
"Fix" : |
  To fix the issue:
  
  1. Run the following command to renew the generated certificate manually:

     ```powershell
     Update-AksHciClusterCertificates  -Name my-workload -cluster -fixKubeletCredentials
     ```
  
  2. Generate new credentials:

     ```powershell
     Get-AksHciCredential -name <clustername>
     ```

  After a few minutes, try the `kubectl` command again to see if the cluster is now available.
