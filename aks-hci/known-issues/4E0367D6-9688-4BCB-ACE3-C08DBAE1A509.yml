"Issue" : |
  Authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
"Description" : |
  You may see this error when deploying a new AKS cluster or adding a node pool to an existing cluster.
"Fix" : |
  1. Check that the user who has run the command is the same user that installed AKS on Azure Stack or Windows Server. For more information on granting access to multiple users, see [Set up multiple administrators](set-multiple-administrators.md)
  2. If the user is the same and the error persists, follow the below steps to resolve the issue:
    - Delete old management appliance certificate by removing `$env:UserProfile.wssd\kvactl\cloudconfig`
    - Run `Repair-AksHciCerts`.
    - Run `Get-AksHciCluster` to check that it's fixed
