  New-AksHciCluster times out when creating an AKS cluster with 200 nodes
"Description" : |
  The deployment of a large cluster may time out after two hours. However, this is a static time-out.
"Fix" : |
  You can ignore this time-out occurrence as the operation is running in the background. Use the `kubectl get nodes` command to access your cluster and monitor the progress.
