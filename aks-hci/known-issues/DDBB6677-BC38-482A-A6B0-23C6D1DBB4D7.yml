  ## 35 PowerShell deployment doesn't check for available memory before creating a new workload cluster
"Description" : |
  The **Aks-Hci** PowerShell commands do not validate the available memory on the host server before creating Kubernetes nodes. This issue can lead to memory exhaustion and virtual machines that do not start. This failure is currently not handled gracefully, and the deployment will stop responding with no clear error message.
"Fix" : |
  If you have a deployment that stops responding, open Event Viewer and check for a Hyper-V-related error message indicating there's not enough memory to start the VM.
