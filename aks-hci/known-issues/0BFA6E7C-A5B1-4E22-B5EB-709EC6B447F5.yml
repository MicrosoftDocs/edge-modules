  Running the Remove-ClusterNode command evicts the node from the failover cluster, but the node still exists
"Description" : |
  When running the [Remove-ClusterNode](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/remove-clusternode?view=windowsserver2019-ps&preserve-view=true) command, the node is evicted from the failover cluster, but if [Remove-AksHciNode](./reference/ps/remove-akshcinode.md) isn't run afterwards, the node will still exist in CloudAgent.

  Since the node was removed from the cluster, but not from CloudAgent, if you use the VHD to create a new node, a _File not found_ error appears. This issue occurs because the VHD is in shared storage, and the evicted node doesn't have access to it.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, remove a physical node from the cluster and then follow the steps below:

  1. Run `Remove-AksHciNode` to de-register the node from CloudAgent.
  2. Perform routine maintenance, such as re-imaging the machine.
  3. Add the node back to the cluster.
  4. Run `Add-AksHciNode` to register the node with CloudAgent.
