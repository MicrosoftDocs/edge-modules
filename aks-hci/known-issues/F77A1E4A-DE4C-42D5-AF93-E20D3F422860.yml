  ContainerD is unable to pull the pause image as 'kubelet' mistakenly collects the image
"Description" : |
  When _kubelet_ is under disk pressure, it collects unused container images, which may include pause images, and when this happens, ContainerD can't pull the image. 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, run the following steps:

  1. Connect to the affected node using SSH, and run the following command:

    ```
    sudo su
    ```

  2. To pull the image, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    crictl pull ecpacr.azurecr.io/kube-proxy:<Kubernetes version>
    ```
