  ContainerD is unable to pull the pause image as 'kubelet' mistakenly collects the image.
"Description" : |
  When _kubelet_ is under disk pressure, it collects unused container images, which may include pause images, and when this happens, ContainerD can't pull the image. 

  Currently, AKS hybrid uses Azure Container Registry (ACR) only with authentication disabled as a workaround for an ACR bug. Therefore, the same credentials shipped to customers could be used to pull the pause images on affected nodes - for example, username: 1516df5a-f1cc-4a6a-856c-03d127b02d05, password: 92684690-48b5-4dce-856d-ef4cccb54f22.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, run the following steps:

  1. Connect to the affected node using SSH, and run the following command:

    ```
    sudo su
    ```

  2. To pull the image, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    crictl pull --creds aaa:bbb ecpacr.azurecr.io/pause:3.2
    ```
