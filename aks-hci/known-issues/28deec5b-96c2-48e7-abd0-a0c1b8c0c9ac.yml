  Error: Install-AksHci fails with 'GetRelease error returned by API call: File download error: Hash mismatch.'
"Description" : |
  The `Install-AksHci` cmdlet fails with 'GetRelease error returned by API call: File download error: Hash mismatch.'
"Fix" : |
  1. Open PowerShell and run `Uninstall-AksHci`.
  2. Retry an installation.
  3. If the issue persists, use the `-concurrentDownloads` parameter with [Set-AksHciConfig](./reference/ps/set-akshciconfig.md) and set it to a number lower than the default 10 before retrying an installation. Reducing the number of concurrent downloads may help sensitive networks complete large file downloads successfully. This parameter is a preview feature.
