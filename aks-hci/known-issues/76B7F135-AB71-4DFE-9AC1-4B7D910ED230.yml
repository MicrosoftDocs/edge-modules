  When upgrading a deployment, some pods might be stuck at 'waiting for static pods to have a ready condition'
"Description" : |
  Pods stuck at _waiting for static pods to have a ready condition_.
"Fix" : |
  To release the pods and resolve this issue, you should restart _kubelet_. To view the NotReady node with the static pods, run the following command: 

  ```Console
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

  To get more information on the faulty node, run the following command:

  ```Console
  kubectl describe node <IP of the node>
  ```

  Use SSH to log into the NotReady node by running the following command:
  ```
  ssh -i <path of the private key file> administrator@<IP of the node>
  ```

  Then, to restart _kubelet_, run the following command: 

  ```powershell
  /etc/.../kubelet restart
  ```
