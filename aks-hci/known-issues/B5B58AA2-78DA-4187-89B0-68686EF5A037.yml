"Issue" : |
  Storage pod crashes and the logs say that the `createSubDir` parameter is invalid
"Description" : |
  An error can occur if you have an SMB or NFS CSI driver installed in your deployment and you upgrade to the May build from an older version. One of the parameters, called `createSubDir`, is no longer accepted. If this applies to your deployment, follow the instructions below to resolve the storage class failure. 

  If you experience this error, the storage pod crashes and the logs indicate that the `createSubDir` parameter is invalid. 

"Fix" : |
  Recreate the storage class.
