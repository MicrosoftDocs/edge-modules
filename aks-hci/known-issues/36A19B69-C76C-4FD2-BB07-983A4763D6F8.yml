  Install-AksHci timed out with the error ''.
"Description" : |
  After running [Install-AksHci](./reference/ps/install-akshci.md), the installation stopped and displayed the following error message:

  ```bash
  \kubectl.exe --kubeconfig=C:\AksHci\0.9.7.3\kubeconfig-clustergroup-management 
  get akshciclusters -o json returned a non zero exit code 1 
  [Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp 192.168.0.150:6443: 
  connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party 
  did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection 
  failed because connected host has failed to respond.]
  ```

  There are multiple reasons why an installation might fail with the `waiting for API server` error. 
"Fix" : |
  The following section outlines possible causes and solutions for this error.

  **Reason 1: Incorrect IP gateway configuration**
  If you're using static IP addresses and you received the following error message, confirm that the configuration for the IP address and gateway is correct. 
  ```PowerShell
  Install-AksHci 
  C:\AksHci\kvactl.exe create --configfile C:\AksHci\yaml\appliance.yaml  --outfile C:\AksHci\kubeconfig-clustergroup-management returned a non-zero exit code 1 [ ]
  ```

  To check whether you have the right configuration for your IP address and gateway, run the following command: 

  ```powershell
  ipconfig /all
  ```

  In the displayed configuration settings, confirm the configuration. You could also attempt to ping the IP gateway and DNS server. 
  
  ```powershell
  ping <DNS server>
  ```

  If these methods don't work, use [New-AksHciNetworkSetting](./reference/ps/new-akshcinetworksetting.md) to change the configuration.

  **Reason 2: Incorrect DNS server**
  If you're using static IP addresses, confirm that the DNS server is correctly configured. To check the host's DNS server address, use the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-NetIPConfiguration.DNSServer | ?{ $_.AddressFamily -ne 23} ).ServerAddresses
  ```

  Confirm that the DNS server address is the same as the address used when running `New-AksHciNetworkSetting` by running the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-MocConfig
  ```

  If the DNS server has been incorrectly configured, reinstall AKS on Azure Stack HCI with the correct DNS server. For more information, see [Restart, remove, or reinstall Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI ](./restart-cluster.md).

  The issue was resolved after deleting the configuration and restarting the VM with a new configuration.
