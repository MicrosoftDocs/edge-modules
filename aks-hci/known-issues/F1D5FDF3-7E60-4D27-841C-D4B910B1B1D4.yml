  Error: 'Waiting for pod 'Cloud Operator' to be ready'
"Description" : |
  When attempting to deploy an AKS cluster on an Azure VM, the installation was stuck at `Waiting for pod 'Cloud Operator' to be ready...`, and then failed and timed out after two hours. Attempts to troubleshoot by checking the gateway and DNS server showed they were working appropriately. Checks for IP or MAC address conflicts found none. The logs didn't show the VIP pool. There was a restriction on pulling the container image using `sudo docker pull ecpacr.azurecr.io/kube-vip:0.3.4` that returned a Transport Layer Security (TLS) timeout instead of _unauthorized_. 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, do the following steps:

  1. Start to deploy your cluster.
  2. When the cluster is deployed, connect to your management cluster VM through SSH as shown below:

    ```
    ssh -i (Get-MocConfig)['sshPrivateKey'] clouduser@<IP Address>
    ```

  3. Change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) setting. Don't hesitate to make the change; if you make the change too late, the deployment fails. Modifying the MTU setting helps unblock the container image pull.

    ```
    sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1300
    ```

  4. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:
    ```
    sudo docker ps -a
    ```

  After you perform these steps, the container image pull should be unblocked.
