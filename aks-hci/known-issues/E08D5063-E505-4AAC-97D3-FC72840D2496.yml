"Issue" : |
  When multiple versions of PowerShell modules are installed, Windows Admin Center does not pick the latest version.
"Description" : |
  If you have multiple versions of the PowerShell modules installed (for example, 0.2.26, 0.2.27, and 0.2.28), Windows Admin Center may not use the latest version (or the one it requires).
"Fix" : |
  Make sure you have only one PowerShell module installed. You should uninstall all unused PowerShell versions of the PowerShell modules and leave just one installed. More information on which Windows Admin Center version is compatible with which PowerShell version can be found in the AKS on Azure Stack HCI [release notes.](https://github.com/Azure/aks-hci/releases).
