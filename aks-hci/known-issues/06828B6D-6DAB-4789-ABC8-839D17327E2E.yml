  Only the user who set up the AKS host can create clusters
"Description" : |
  When deploying Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI through Windows Admin Center, only the user who set up the AKS host can create Kubernetes clusters.
"Fix" : |
  To work around this issue, copy the _wssd_ folder from the profile of the user who set up the AKS host to the profile of the user who will be creating the new Kubernetes clusters.
