"Issue" : |
  Error: invalid_client. The provided client secret keys are expired.
"Description" : |
  This error usually occurs when service principal (SPN) secret you used when running the PowerShell cmdlet running **Enable-AksHciArcConnection** expired. 
"Fix" : |
  Visit the Azure Portal to create a new secret for your service principal (SPN). You can also use [certificate credentials for added security](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials). For example of using the cmdlet, see [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md).
