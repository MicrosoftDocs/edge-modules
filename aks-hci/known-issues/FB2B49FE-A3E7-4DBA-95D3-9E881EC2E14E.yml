"Issue" : |
  Restarting Azure Stack HCI nodes causes timing issue.
"Description" : |
  Restarting the Azure Stack HCI cluster nodes hosting the management cluster and workload clusters may cause the workload clusters to disappear from the WAC dashboard. 
"Fix" : |
  To work around this issue, pause and drain the nodes before you plan to restart them. Sometimes, the workload clusters may just take longer to appear in the dashboard.
