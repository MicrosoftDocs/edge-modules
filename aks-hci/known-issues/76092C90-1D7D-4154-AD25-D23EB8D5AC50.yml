"Issue" : |
  After a failed installation, running Install-AksHci does not work.
"Description" : |
  This issue happens because a failed installation may result in leaked resources that have to be cleaned up before you can install again.
"Fix" : |
  If your installation fails using [Install-AksHci](./reference/ps/uninstall-akshci.md), you should run [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/uninstall-akshci.md) before running `Install-AksHci` again.
