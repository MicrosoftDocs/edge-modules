  Create Windows Admin Center logs.
"Description" : |
  When you report problems with Windows Admin Center, it's a good idea to attach logs to help the development team diagnose your problem. Errors in Windows Admin Center generally come in one of two forms: 
  - Events that appear in the event viewer on the machine running Windows Admin Center 
  - JavaScript problems that surface in the browser console 
"Fix" : |
  To collect logs for Windows Admin Center, use the `Get-SMEUILogs.ps1` script that's provided in the public preview package. 
  
  To use the script, run this command in the folder where your script is stored: 
  
  ```PowerShell
  ./Get-SMEUILogs.ps1 -ComputerNames [comp1, comp2, etc.] -Destination [comp3] -HoursAgo [48] -NoCredentialPrompt
  ```
  
  The command has the following parameters:
  
  - `-ComputerNames`: A list of machines you want to collect logs from.
  - `-Destination`: The machine you want to aggregate the logs to.
  - `-HoursAgo`: The start time for collecting logs, expressed in hours before the time you run the script.
  - `-NoCredentialPrompt`: A switch to turn off the credentials prompt and use the default credentials in your current environment.
  
  If you have difficulties running this script, you can run the following command to view the Help text: 
  
  ```PowerShell
  GetHelp .\Get-SMEUILogs.ps1 -Examples
