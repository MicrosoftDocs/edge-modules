  When creating a persistent volume, an attempt to mount the volume fails.
"Description" : |
  After deleting a persistent volume or a persistent volume claim in an AKS on Azure Stack HCI environment, a new persistent volume is created to map to the same share. However, when attempting to mount the volume, the mount fails, and the pod times out with the error, `NewSmbGlobalMapping failed`.
"Fix" : |
  To work around the failure to mount the new volume, you can SSH into the Windows node and run `Remove-SMBGlobalMapping` and provide the share that corresponds to the volume. After running this command, attempts to mount the volume should succeed.
