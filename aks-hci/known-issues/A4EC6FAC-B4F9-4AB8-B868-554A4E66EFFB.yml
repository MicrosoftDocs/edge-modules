  Container storage interface pod stuck in a 'ContainerCreating' state.
"Description" : |
  A new Kubernetes workload cluster was created with Kubernetes version 1.16.10, and then updated to 1.16.15. After the update, the `csi-msk8scsi-node-9x47m` pod was stuck in the _ContainerCreating_ state, and the `kube-proxy-qqnkr` pod was stuck in the _Terminating_ state as shown in the output below:

  ```output

  ```
"Fix" : |
  Since `kubelet` ended up in a bad state and can no longer talk to the API server, the only solution is to restart the `kubelet` service. After restarting, the cluster goes into a _running_ state.
