"Issue" : |
  When using kubectl to delete a node, the associated VM might not be deleted.
"Description" : |
  You'll see this issue if you follow these steps:

  1. Create a Kubernetes cluster.
  2. Scale the cluster to more than two nodes.
  3. Delete a node by running the following command: 
    ```powershell
    kubectl delete node <node-name>
    ```

  4. Return a list of the nodes by running the following command:
    ```powershell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    The removed node isn't listed in the output.
  5. Open a PowerShell with administrative privileges and run the following command:
    ```powershell
    get-vm
    ```
  The removed node is still listed.
"Fix" : |
  This failure causes the system not to recognize that the node is missing, and therefore, a new node won't spin up.
