  Error: 'Install-Moc failed. Exception [This typically indicates an issue happened while registering the resource name as a computer object with the domain controller and/or the DNS server. Please check if the Cluster Computer Object has permissions to create Computer Object in domain controller. Please check the domain controller and DNS logs for related error messages.'
"Description" : |
  This typically indicates that the Cluster Name Object (CNO) representing your underlying failover cluster in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) does not have permissions to create a Virtual Computer Object (VCO) in the Organizational Unit (OU) or in the container where the cluster resides.
"Fix" : |
  If you are not a domain administrator, you can ask one to 
  [grant the CNO permissions to the OU](/windows-server/failover-clustering/prestage-cluster-adds#grant-the-cno-permissions-to-the-ou)
  or [prestage a VCO for the cloud agent generic cluster service](./prestage-cluster-service-host-create.md).
  
  If you are a domain administrator, it is still possible that your OU or container does not have the required permissions. 
  For example, Enforcement mode, introduced in [KB5008383](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/topic/kb5008383-active-directory-permissions-updates-cve-2021-42291-536d5555-ffba-4248-a60e-d6cbc849cde1?), 
  may be enabled in Active Directory. Try the following before attempting a reinstall.
  
  1. Navigate to **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
  2. Right-click on the OU or container where the cluster resides.
  3. Select **Delegate Control...** to open the **Delegation of Control Wizard**.
  4. Click **Next** > Click **Add...** to open the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups** window.
  5. Select your choice of group or users to whom you want to delegate control > Click **OK**.
  6. Select **Create a custom task to delegate** > Click **Next** to move on to the **Active Directory Object Type** page.
  7. Select **Only the following objects in the folder** > Select **Computer objects** > Select **Create selected objects in this folder** and **Delete selected objects in this folder** > Click **Next** to move on to the **Permissions** page.
  8. Select **Create all Child Objects** and **Delete All Child Objects** from the list of permissions > Click **Next** > **Finish**
  
  If a reinstall fails, retry the above with the following changes to Steps 7 and 8:
  * Step 7: Select **This folder, existing objects in this folder, and creation of new objects in this folder** > Click **Next**.
  * Step 8: Select **Read**, **Write**, **Create All Child Objects**, and **Delete All Child Objects** from the list of permissions > Click **Next** > Click **Finish**.
