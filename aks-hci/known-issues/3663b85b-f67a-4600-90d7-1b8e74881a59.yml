  Get-AksHciCredential fails with "cannot find the path specified" error
"Description" : |
  The `Get-AksHciCredential` PowerShell cmdlet fails when executed by a different admin user than the one used for installing AksHci. The command creates a .kube directory and place the config file in it. However, the command fails with the following error:

  `Error: open C:\Users\<user>\.kube\config: The system cannot find the path specified.`

  ### To reproduce

  1. Install AksHci.
  2. Create a target cluster.
  3. Sign in to the machine as a different admin user (multi-admin feature).
  4. Run `Get-AksHciCredential -Name $clusterName`.

  ### Expected behavior

  `Get-AksHciCredential` should be able to create a .kube directory in the user's home directory and place the config file in that directory.
 
"Fix" : |
  To work around the issue, create a **.kube** directory in the user's home directory. Use the following command to create the directory:
  
  ```shell
  mkdir "$HOME/.kube"
  ```
  
  After this step, `Get-AksHciCredential` should not fail.
