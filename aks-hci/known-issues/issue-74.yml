## 74 When upgrading a deployment, some pods might be stuck at _waiting for static pods to have a ready condition_
To release the pods and resolve this issue, you should restart _kubelet_. To view the NotReady node with the static pods, run the following command: 

```Console
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

To get more information on the faulty node, run the following command:

```Console
kubectl describe node <IP of the node>
```

Use SSH to log into the NotReady node by running the following command:
```
ssh -i <path of the private key file> administrator@<IP of the node>
```

Then, to restart _kubelet_, run the following command: 

```powershell
/etc/.../kubelet restart
```
