  Error: Install-AksHci fails with 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host'.
"Description" : |
  `Install-AksHci` failed with this error because the IP pool ranges provided in the AKS on Azure Stack HCI configuration was off by 1 in the CIDR, and can cause CloudAgent to crash. For example, if you have subnet 10.0.0.0/21 with an address range 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.7.255, and then you use start address of 10.0.0.1 or an end address of 10.0.7.254, then this would cause CloudAgent to crash. 
"Fix" : |
  To work around this issue, run [New-AksHciNetworkSetting](./reference/ps/new-akshcinetworksetting.md), and use any other valid IP address range for your VIP pool and Kubernetes node pool. Make sure that the values you use are not off by 1 at the start or end of the address range.
