"Issue" : |
  KMS pod fails and the KMS pod logs contain errors
"Description" : |
  Some possible symptoms of this issue are:

  - `kubectl get secrets` fails with an internal error.
  - `kubectl logs <kmspod-name> -n kube-system` contains errors.
  - Mounting secrets fails in volumes when you try to create pods.
  - The apiserver fails to start.
 
"Fix" : |
  Look in the KMS pod logs for errors by running the following command:

  `kubectl logs <kmspod-name> -n kube-system`

  If the logs return an error regarding an invalid token in the management cluster KMS pod, run the following command:

  `Update-AksHciCertificates`

  If there is an error regarding an invalid token in the target cluster KMS pod, run the following command:

  `UpdateAksHciClusterCertificates -name <cluster-name> -fixcloudcredential `
