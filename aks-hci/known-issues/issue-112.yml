## 112 Moving virtual machines between Azure Stack HCI cluster nodes quickly leads to VM startup failures
When using the cluster administration tool to move a VM from one node (Node A) to another node (Node B) in the Azure Stack HCI cluster, the VM may fail to start on the new node. After moving the VM back to the original node, it will fail to start there as well.

This issue happens because the logic to clean up the first migration runs asynchronously. As a result, Azure Kubernetes Service's "update VM location" logic finds the VM on the original Hyper-V on node A, and deletes it, instead of unregistering it.

To work around this issue, ensure the VM has started successfully on the new node before moving it back to the original node.
