  Error: 'addons.msft.microsoft "demo-arc-onboarding" already exists'.
"Description" : |
  This error usually means that you have already connected your AKS cluster to Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
  To confirm it's connected, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and check under the subscription and resource group you provided when running [Set-AksHciRegistration](./reference/ps/set-akshciregistration.md) (if you've used default values) or [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md) (if you haven't used default values). You can also confirm if your AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster is connected to Azure by running the [az connectedk8s show ](/cli/azure/connectedk8s#az-connectedk8s-show) Azure CLI command. If you do not see your workload cluster, run `Disable-AksHciArcConnection` and try again.
