  Attempt to create new workload clusters failed because the AKS host was turned off for several days
"Description" : |
  An AKS cluster deployed in an Azure VM was previously working fine, but after the AKS host was turned off for several days, the `Kubectl` command didn't work. After running either the `Kubectl get nodes` or `Kubectl get services` command, this error message appeared: `Error from server (InternalError): an error on the server ("") has prevented the request from succeeding`.
"Fix" : |
  This issue occurred because the AKS host was turned off for longer than four days, which caused the certificates to expire. Certificates are frequently rotated in a four-day cycle. Run [Repair-AksHciClusterCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshciclustercerts.md) to fix the certificate expiration issue.
