  Install-AksHci failed on a multi-node installation with the error 'Nodes have not reached active state'.
"Description" : |
  When running [Install-AksHci](./reference/ps/install-akshci.md) on a single-node setup, the installation worked, but when setting up the failover cluster, the installation fails with the error message. However, pinging the cloud agent showed the CloudAgent was reachable.
"Fix" : |
  To ensure all nodes can resolve the CloudAgent's DNS, run the following command on each node:

  ```powershell
  Resolve-DnsName <FQDN of cloudagent>
  ```

  When the step above succeeds on the nodes, make sure the nodes can reach the CloudAgent port to verify that a proxy is not trying to block this connection and the port is open. To do this, run the following command on each node:

  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection  <FQDN of cloudagent> -Port <Cloudagent port - default 65000>
