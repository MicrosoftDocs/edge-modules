  In a workload cluster with static IP, all pods in a node are stuck in a 'ContainerCreating' state.
"Description" : |
  In a workload cluster with static IP and Windows nodes, all of the pods in a node (including the `daemonset` pods) are stuck in a _ContainerCreating_ state. When attempting to connect to that node using SSH, it fails with a `Connection timed out` error.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, use Hyper-V Manager or the Failover Cluster Manager to turn off the VM of that node. After five to ten minutes, the node should have been recreated and with all the pods running.
