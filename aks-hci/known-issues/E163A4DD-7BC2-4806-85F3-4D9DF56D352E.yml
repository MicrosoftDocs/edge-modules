  In a workload cluster with static IP addresses, all pods in a node are stuck in a 'ContainerCreating' state
"Description" : |
  In a workload cluster with static IP addresses and Windows nodes, all of the pods in a node (including the `daemonset` pods) are stuck in a _ContainerCreating_ state. When attempting to connect to that node using SSH, the connection fails with a `Connection timed out` error.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, use Hyper-V Manager or Failover Cluster Manager to turn off the VM of that node. After 5 to 10 minutes, the node should have been recreated and with all the pods running.
