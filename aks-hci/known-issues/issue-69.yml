## 69 When running Update-AksHci, the update process was stuck at `Waiting for deployment 'AksHci Billing Operator' to be ready`

This status message appears when running the [Update-AksHci](./reference/ps/update-akshci.md) PowerShell cmdlet. Review the following root causes to resolve the issue:

* **Reason one**:
   During the update of the _AksHci Billing Operator_, the _Operator_ incorrectly marked itself as out of policy. To resolve this issue, open up a new PowerShell window and run [Sync-AksHciBilling](./reference/ps/sync-akshcibilling.md). You should see the billing operation continue within the next 20-30 minutes. 

* **Reason two**:
   The management cluster VM may be out of memory, which causes the API server to be unreachable, and consequently, makes all commands from [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md), billing, and update run into a timeout. As a workaround, set the management cluster VM to 32 GB in Hyper-V and reboot it. 

* **Reason three**:
   The _AksHci Billing Operator_ may be out of storage space, which is due to a bug in the Microsoft SQL configuration settings. The lack of storage space may be causing the upgrade to stop responding. To work around this issue, manually resize the billing pod `pvc` using the following steps. 

   1. Run the following command to edit the pod settings:

      ```
      kubectl edit pvc mssql-data-claim --kubeconfig (Get-AksHciConfig).Kva.kubeconfig -n azure-arc
      ```

   2. When Notepad or another editor opens with a YAML file, edit the line for storage from 100Mi to 5Gi:

      ```
      spec:
        resources:
          requests:
            **storage: 5Gi**
       ```

   3. Check the status of the billing deployment using the following command:

      ```
      kubectl get deployments/billing-manager-deployment --kubeconfig (Get-AksHciConfig).Kva.kubeconfig -n azure-arc
      ```
