  Using Remote Desktop to connect to the management cluster produces a connection error.
"Description" : |
  When using Remote Desktop (RDP) to connect to one of the nodes in an Azure Stack HCI cluster and then running [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md), an error appears and says the connection failed because the host failed to respond.

  The reason for the connection failure is because some PowerShell commands that use `kubeconfig-mgmt` fail with an error similar to the following one:

  ```
  Unable to connect to the server: d ial tcp 172.168.10.0:6443, where 172.168.10.0 is the IP of the control plane.
  ```

  The _kube-vip_ pod can go down for two reasons:

  * The memory pressure in the system can slow down `etcd`, which ends up affecting _kube-vip_.
  * The _kube-apiserver_ is not available.
"Fix" : |
  To help resolve this issue, try rebooting the machine. However, the issue of the memory pressure slowing down may return.
