"Issue" : |
  A WinRM error is displayed when creating a new workload cluster.
"Description" : |
  When switching from DHCP to static IP, Windows Admin Center displayed an error that said the WinRM client cannot process the request. This error also occurred outside of Windows Admin Center. WinRM broke when static IP addresses were used, and the servers were not registering a Service Principal Name (SPN) when moving to static IP addresses. 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, use the **SetSPN** command to create the SPN. From a command prompt on the Windows Admin Center gateway, run the following command: 

  ```
  Setspn /Q WSMAN/<FQDN on the Azure Stack HCI Server> 
  ```

  Next, if any of the servers in the environment return the message `No Such SPN Found`, then log in to that server and run the following commands:  

  ```
  Setspn /S WSMAN/<server name> <server name> 
  Setspn /S WSMAN/<FQDN of server> <server name> 
  ```

  Finally, on the Windows Admin Center gateway, run the following to ensure that it gets new server information from the domain controller:

  ```
  Klist purge 
  ```
