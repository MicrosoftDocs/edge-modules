  Nodeagent leaking ports when unable to join cloudagent due to expired token when cluster not upgraded for more than 60 days
"Description" : |
  When a cluster has not been upgraded for more than 60 days, the node agent fails to start during a node agent restart because of token expiry. This causes the agents to be in the starting phase. Continuous attempts to join the cloudagent may exhaust the supply of ports on the host. The status for the following command will be **Starting**.

  ```powershell
  Get-Service wssdagent | Select-Object -Property Name, Status
  ```

  Expected behavior: The node agent will be in the starting phase, which will constantly try joining the cloud agent, exhausting the ports.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve the issue, you'll need to first stop the wssdagent from running. Since the service is in the starting phase, it may prevent you from stopping the service. You'll need to kill the process before attempting to stop the service.

  1. Confirm the wssdagent is in starting phase.
      ```powershell
      Get-Service wssdagent | Select-Object -Property Name, Status
      ```

  1. Kill the process.
      ```powershell
      kill -Name wssdagent -Force
      ```

  1. Stop the service.
      ```powershell
      Stop-Service wssdagent -Force
      ```
    
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Even after stopping the service, the wssdagent process appears to start in a few seconds for a couple of times before stopping. Before proceeding to the next step, make sure the following command returns an error on all the nodes.
    
    ```powershell
    Get-Process -Name wssdagent
    ```
    
    ```output  
    PS C:\WINDOWs\system32 Get-process -Name wssdagent 
    Get-process : Cannot find a process with the name "wssdaqent". Verify the process name and call the cmdlet again.
    At line: 1 char: 1 
    + Get-process -Name wssdagent
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + Categorylnfo          : ObjectNotFound: (wssdagent:String) [Get-Process], ProcessCommandException 
        + FullyQua1ifiedErrorId : NoProcess FoundForGivenName , Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Getprocesscommand
    ```

  1. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 at each node of the HCI cluster that has this issue.

  1. After confirming the wssdagent is not running, start the cloudagent if it isn't running.
    ```powershell
    Start-ClusterGroup -Name (Get-MocConfig).clusterRoleName
    ```

  1. Confirm the cloudagent is up and running.
      ```powershell
      Get-ClusterGroup -Name (Get-MocConfig).clusterRoleName
      ```

  1. Run the following command to fix the wssdagent:
      ```powershell
      Repair-Moc
      ```

  1. Once this command completes, the wssdagent should be in running state.
      ```powershell
      Get-Service wssdagent | Select-Object -Property Name, Status
      ```
