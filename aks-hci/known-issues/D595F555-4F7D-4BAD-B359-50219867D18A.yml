  If a cluster is shut down for more than four days, the cluster will be unreachable.
"Description" : |
  When you shut down a management or workload cluster for more than four days, the certificates expire and the cluster is unreachable. The certificates expire because they're rotated every 3-4 days for security reasons.
"Fix" : |
  To restart the cluster, you need to manually repair the certificates before you can perform any cluster operations. To repair the certificates, run the following [Repair-AksHciClusterCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshciclustercerts.md) command:

  ```powershell
  Repair-AksHciClusterCerts -Name <cluster-name> -fixKubeletCredentials
  ```
