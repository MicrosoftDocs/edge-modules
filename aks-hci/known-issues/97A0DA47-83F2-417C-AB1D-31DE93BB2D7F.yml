  Update of host OS HCI to HCIv2 breaks AKS on Azure Stack HCI installation: OutOfCapacity.
"Description" : |
  Running an OS update on a host with an AKS on Azure Stack HCI deployment can cause the deployment to enter a bad state and fail day two operations. The MOC NodeAgent Services may fail to start on updated hosts. All MOC calls to the nodes will fail.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This issue only happens occasionally.

  To reproduce: When you update a cluster with an existing AKS deployment from HCI to HCIv2, an AKS operation such as `New-AksHciCluster` may fail. The error message will state the MOC nodes are **OutOfCapacity**. For example:

  ```PowerShell
  System.Collections.Hashtable.generic_non_zero1 [Error: failed to create nic test-load-balancer-whceb-nic for machinetest-load-balancer-whceb: unable to create VM network interface: failed to create network interface test-load-balancer-whceb-nic in resource group clustergroup-test: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Location 'MocLocation' doesn't expose any nodes to create VNIC 'test-load-balancer-whceb-nic' on: OutOfCapacity]
  ```
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, start the wssdagent Moc NodeAgent Service on the affected nodes. This will solve the issue, and bring the deployment back to a good state. Run the following command:

  ```PowerShell
  Get-ClusterNode -ErrorAction Stop | ForEach-Object { Invoke-Command -ComputerName $_ -ScriptBlock { Start-Service wssdagent -WarningAction:SilentlyContinue } }
  ```
