  Error: 'Connection to Azure failed. Please run 'Set-AksHciRegistration' and try again'.
"Description" : |
  This error means that your login credentials to Azure have expired. 
"Fix" : |
  Use [Set-AksHciRegistration](./reference/ps/set-akshciregistration.md) to log in to Azure before running the [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md) command again. When rerunning `Set-AksHciRegistration`, make sure you use the same subscription and resource group details you used when you first registered the AKS host to Azure for billing. If you rerun the command with a different subscription or resource group, they will not be registered. Once the subscription and resource group are set in `Set-AksHciRegistration`, they cannot be changed without uninstalling AKS hybrid.
