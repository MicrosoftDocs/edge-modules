  AKS hybrid goes out-of-policy if a workload cluster hasn't been created in 60 days.
"Description" : |
  If you created a management cluster but haven't deployed a workload cluster in the first 60 days, you'll be blocked from creating one after that because it's out-of-policy. In this situation, when you run [Update-AksHci](./reference/ps/update-akshci.md), the update process is blocked with the error _Waiting for deployment 'AksHci Billing Operator' to be ready_. If you run [Sync-AksHciBilling](./reference/ps/sync-akshcibilling.md), it returns successful output. However, if you run [Get-AksHciBillingStatus](./reference/ps/get-akshcibillingstatus.md), the connection status is _OutofPolicy_.

  If you haven't deployed a workload cluster in 60 days, the billing goes out of policy. 
"Fix" : |
  The only way to fix this issue is to redeploy with a clean installation.
