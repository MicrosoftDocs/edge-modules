  Get-AksHCIClusterNetwork does not show the current allocation of IP addresses.
"Description" : |
  Running the [Get-AksHciClusterNetwork](./reference/ps/get-akshciclusternetwork.md) command provides a list of all virtual network configurations. However, the command does not show the current allocation of the IP addresses. 
"Fix" : |
  To find out what IP addresses are currently in use in a virtual network, use the steps below:

  1. To get the group, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-MocGroup -location MocLocation
    ```
  2. To get the list of IP addresses that are currently in use, and the list of available or used virtual IP addresses, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-MocNetworkInterface -Group <groupName> | ConvertTo-Json -depth 10
    ```

  3. Use the following command to view the list of virtual IP addresses that are currently in use: 

    ```powershell
    Get-MocLoadBalancer -Group <groupName> | ConvertTo-Json -depth 10
    ```
