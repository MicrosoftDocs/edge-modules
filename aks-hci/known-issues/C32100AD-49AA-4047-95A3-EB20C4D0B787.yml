  When you deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI with a misconfigured network, deployment timed out at various points.
"Description" : |
  When you deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI, the deployment may time out at different points of the process depending on where the misconfiguration occurred. You should review the error message to determine the cause and where it occurred.

  For example, in the following error, the point at which the misconfiguration occurred is in `Get-DownloadSdkRelease -Name "mocstack-stable"`: 

  ```
  $vnet = New-AksHciNetworkSettingSet-AksHciConfig -vnet $vnetInstall-AksHciVERBOSE: 
  Initializing environmentVERBOSE: [AksHci] Importing ConfigurationVERBOSE: 
  [AksHci] Importing Configuration Completedpowershell : 
  GetRelease - error returned by API call: 
  Post "https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com/api/v1.1/contents/default/namespaces/default/names/mocstack-stable/versions/0.9.7.0/files?action=generateDownloadInfo&ForegroundPriority=True" : 
  dial tcp 52.184.220.11:443: connectex: 
  A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly
  respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because
  connected host has failed to respond.At line:1 char:1+ powershell -command
  { Get-DownloadSdkRelease -Name "mocstack-stable"}
  ```

  This indicates that the physical Azure Stack HCI node can resolve the name of the download URL, `msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com`, but the node can't connect to the target server.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, you need to determine where the breakdown occurred in the connection flow. Here are some steps to try to resolve the issue from the physical cluster node:

  1. Ping the destination DNS name: ping `msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com`. 
  2. If you get a response back and no time-out, then the basic network path is working. 
  3. If the connection times out, then there could be a break in the data path. For more information, see [check proxy settings](./set-proxy-settings.md). Or, there could be a break in the return path, so you should check the firewall rules.
