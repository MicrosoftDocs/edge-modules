  Arc-connected clusters have empty JSON "distribution" property
"Description" : |
  Azure Arc for Kubernetes-connected clusters can have the value for the JSON property `distribution` set to an empty string. For AKS hybrid connected clusters, this value is set during initial installation and is never altered for the lifetime of the deployment.

  ### To reproduce

  Open an Azure PowerShell window and run the following commands:

  ```powershell
  az login
  az account set --subscription <sub_id>
  az connectedk8s show -g <rg_name> -n
  ```

  The following is example output from this command:

  ```shell
  {
  "agentPublicKeyCertificate": <value>
  "agentVersion": "1.8.14",
  "azureHybridBenefit": "NotApplicable",
  "connectivityStatus": "Connected",
  "distribution": "",
  "distributionVersion": null,
  "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/<cluster name>",

  ### To resolve the issue
   
  If the output for the JSON `distribution` property returns an empty string, follow these instructions to patch your cluster:

  1. Copy the following configuration into a file called **patchBody.json**:

     ```json
     {
        "properties": {
          "distribution": "aks_management"
        }
     }
     ```

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > If your cluster is an AKS management cluster, the value should be set to `aks_management`. If it's a workload cluster, it should be set to `aks_workload`.

  2. From the JSON output you obtained above, copy your connected cluster ID. It should appear as a long string in the following format:

      `"/subscriptions/<subscription >/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/<cluster name>",`

  3. Run the following command to patch your cluster. The `<cc_arm_id>` value should be the ID obtained in step 2:

     ```powershell
     az rest -m patch -u "<cc_arm_id>?api-version=2022-10-01-preview" -b "@patchBody.json"
     ```

  4. Check that your cluster has been successfully patched by running `az connectedk8s show -g <rg_name> -n <cc_name>` to make sure the JSON property `distribution` has been correctly set.
