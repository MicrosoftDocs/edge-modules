  MOC agents don't start after an upgrade failure
"Description" : |
  When AKS-HCI fails to upgrade from the May release to the June release, the expectation is that AKS-HCI should revert to the May release and continue to function. But it leaves MOC agents in a stopped state, and manual attempts to start the agent don't activate them.

  ### Steps to reproduce

  1. Install AKS-HCI PowerShell module version 1.1.36.
  2. Upgrade AKS-HCI. If the upgrade fails, AKS-HCI doesn't fall back to May and MOC agents are down.

  ### Expected behavior

  If the AksHci upgrade fails, the expectation is that AksHci reverts to the previous release and continues to function without any issues

  ### Symptoms

  #### Mismatch between AksHci version and MOC versions
  `Get-AksHciVersion`
  1.0.10.10513
  `Get-MocVersion`
  1.0.11.10707

  #### Mismatch between Get-MocVersion and wssdcloudagent.exe version
  `Get-MocVersion`` indicates that the June build is installed while the wssdcloudagent.exe version indicates that the May build is installed.
  
  #### MOC agent services image path has deployment ID parameter
  Use the following command to show the image path for the cloud agent:
  `reg query "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wssdcloudagent"`

  ### Example output
  `"C:\Program Files\AksHci\wssdcloudagent.exe" --service --basedir "base dir" --cloudagentfqdn "cloudagent fqdn" --dotfolderpath "dot folder path" --objectdatastore "data store" --clusterresourcename "cluster name" --certificatevalidityfactor 1 --deploymentid "deployment id"`

  Use the following command to show the image path for the node agent:
  'reg query "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wssdagent"'

  ### Example output
  `"C:\Program Files\AksHci\wssdagent.exe" --service --basedir "base dir" --cloudloginfile "cloud login file path" --dotfolderpath "dotfolder path" --nodeagentfqdn "node fqdn" --objectdatastore "object data store" --wssdproviderspec "provider spec" --deploymentid "deployment id"`

"Fix" : |
  To mitigate the issue, run the following PowerShell cmdlets:

  ```powershell
  Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wssdcloudagent" -Name ImagePath -Value 'above cloud agent image path without the deployment id'
  ```
  ``powershell
  Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wssdagent" -Name ImagePath -Value 'above node agent image path without the deployment id'
  ```
