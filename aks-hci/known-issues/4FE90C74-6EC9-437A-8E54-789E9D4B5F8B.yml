"Issue" : |
  Hyper-V manager shows high CPU and/or memory demands for the management cluster (AKS host).
"Description" : |
  When you check Hyper-V manager, high CPU and memory demands for the management cluster can be safely ignored. They're related to spikes in compute resource usage when provisioning workload clusters. 
"Fix" : |
  Increasing the memory or CPU size for the management cluster hasn't shown a significant improvement and can be safely ignored.
