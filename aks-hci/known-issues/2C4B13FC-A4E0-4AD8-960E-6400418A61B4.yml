  Access is denied
"Description" : |
  In Stage 2.1: Basic Step Component, you may encounter this error: "Connecting to remote server *** failed with the following error message: Access is denied. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic" when trying to use your credentials for your server node(s).
"Fix" : |
  Make sure that the account/credentials added is an administrative account on the machine. Then verify that PSRemoting is enabled and remote hosts are trusted. You can do this with the following PowerShell commands:

  ```powershell
  Enable-PSRemoting -Force 
  winrm quickconfig 
  ```

  If you are still encountering issues, [see this troubleshooting guide](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_troubleshooting?view=powershell-7.2).
