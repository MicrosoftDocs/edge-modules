  Network proxy server blocks HTTP requests
"Description" : |
  When applying the platform configuration, the network proxy server blocked HTTP requests originating from the user agent string **Google Chrome 65** because this string is an out-of-date user agent client. 
"Fix" : |
  The user agent will be updated to **Google Chrome 91** in the next release.
