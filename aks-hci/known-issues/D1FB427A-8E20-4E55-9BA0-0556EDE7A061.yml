  Error: 'Install-Moc failed with error - Exception [CloudAgent is unreachable. MOC CloudAgent might be unreachable for the following reasons]'.
"Description" : |
   This error may occur when there's an infrastructure misconfiguration.
"Fix" : |
   Use the following steps to resolve this error:

   1. Check the host DNS server configuration and gateway settings:
      1. Confirm that the DNS server is correctly configured. To check the host's DNS server address, run the following command: 
         ```powershell
         ((Get-NetIPConfiguration).DNSServer | ?{ $_.AddressFamily -ne 23}).ServerAddresses
         ```
      2. To check whether your IP address and gateway configuration are correct, run the command `ipconfig/all`.
      3. Attempt to ping the IP gateway and the DNS server.

   2. Check the CloudAgent service to make sure it's running:
      1. Ping the CloudAgent service to ensure it's reachable.
      2. Make sure all nodes can resolve the CloudAgent's DNS by running the following command on each node:
         ```powershell
         Resolve-DnsName <FQDN of cloudagent>
         ```
      3. When the previous step succeeds on the nodes, make sure the nodes can reach the CloudAgent port to verify that a proxy is not trying to block this connection and the port is open. To do this, run the following command on each node:
         ```powershell
         Test-NetConnection <FQDN of cloudagent> -Port <Cloudagent port - default 65000>
         ```
      4. To check if the cluster service is running for a failover cluster, you can also run the following command:
         ```powershell
         Get-ClusterGroup -Name (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc['clusterRoleName']
         ```
