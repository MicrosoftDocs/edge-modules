  Error: 'Timed out waiting for the condition'
"Description" : |
  This error usually points to one of the following issues:

  - The clusters were created in an Azure VM in a virtualized environment, or you were deploying AKS on Azure Stack HCI on multiple levels of virtualization. 
  - A slow internet caused the timeout.
"Fix" : |
  If one of the above scenarios applies to you, run [Disable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/disable-akshciarcconnection.md), and try connecting again. If the above scenario doesn't apply to you, [open a support issue](./help-support.md) for AKS on Azure Stack HCI.
