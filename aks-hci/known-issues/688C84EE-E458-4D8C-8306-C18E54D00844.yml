"Issue" : |
  Windows Admin Center doesn't have an Arc off-boarding experience.
"Description" : |
  Windows Admin Center does not currently have a process to off-board a cluster from Azure Arc.
"Fix" : |
  To delete Arc agents on a cluster that has been destroyed, navigate to the resource group of the cluster in the Azure portal, and manually delete the Arc content. To delete Arc agents on a cluster that is still up and running, you should run the following command:

  ```azurecli
  az connectedk8s delete --name AzureArcTest1 --resource-group AzureArcTest
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you use the Azure portal to delete the Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource, it removes any associated configuration resources, but does not remove the agents running on the cluster. Best practice is to delete the Kubernetes resource using `az connectedk8s delete` instead of the Azure portal.
