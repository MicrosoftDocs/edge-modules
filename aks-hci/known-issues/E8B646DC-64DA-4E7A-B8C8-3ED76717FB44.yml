  Unable to find repository 'PSGallery'.
"Description" : |
  In stage 2.1: System Validation, you may encounter this error: `Unable to find repository 'PSGallery'.
"Fix" : |
  Use Get-PSRepository to see all available repositories.` when you click install. Complete the PowerShell commands on the node(s) that you are trying to deploy to. Unregister and re-register the PSRepository in an administrative PowerShell window. Close all PowerShell windows afterward.
  ```powershell
  Unregister-PSRepository -Name 'PSGallery'
  Register-PSRepository -Default
  ```

  Uninstall and reinstall PowerShellGet in an administrative PowerShell window. Close all PowerShell windows afterwards.
  ```powershell
  Uninstall-Module PowerShellGet
  Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force
  ```

  After this, go back to Windows Admin Center and retry.
