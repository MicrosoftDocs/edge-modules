  When running Update-AksHci, the update process was stuck at 'Waiting for deployment 'AksHci Billing Operator' to be ready'.
"Description" : |
  This status message appears when running the [Update-AksHci](./reference/ps/update-akshci.md) PowerShell cmdlet. XX
"Fix" : |
  Review the following root causes to resolve the issue:

  * **Reason one**:
    During the update of the _AksHci Billing Operator_, the _Operator_ incorrectly marked itself as out of policy. To resolve this issue, open up a new PowerShell window and run [Sync-AksHciBilling](./reference/ps/sync-akshcibilling.md). You should see the billing operation continue within the next 20-30 minutes. 

  * **Reason two**:
    The management cluster VM may be out of memory, which causes the API server to be unreachable, and consequently, makes all commands from [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md), billing, and update run into a timeout. As a workaround, set the management cluster VM to 32 GB in Hyper-V and reboot it. 

  * **Reason three**:
    The _AksHci Billing Operator_ may be out of storage space, which is due to a bug in the Microsoft SQL configuration settings. The lack of storage space may be causing the upgrade to stop responding. To work around this issue, manually resize the billing pod `pvc` using the following steps. 

    1. Run the following command to edit the pod settings:

        ```
        kubectl edit pvc mssql-data-claim --kubeconfig (Get-AksHciConfig).Kva.kubeconfig -n azure-arc
        ```

    2. When Notepad or another editor opens with a YAML file, edit the line for storage from 100Mi to 5Gi:

        ```
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              **storage: 5Gi**
        ```

    3. Check the status of the billing deployment using the following command:

        ```
        kubectl get deployments/billing-manager-deployment --kubeconfig (Get-AksHciConfig).Kva.kubeconfig -n azure-arc
        ```
