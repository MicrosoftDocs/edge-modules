"Issue" : |
  The Windows or Linux node count can't be seen when Get-AksHciCluster is run
"Description" : |
  If you provision an AKS cluster on Azure Stack HCI with zero Linux or Windows nodes, when you run [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md), you'll get an empty string or null value as your output.
"Fix" : |
  Null is an expected return for zero nodes.
