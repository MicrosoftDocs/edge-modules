  Error 'System.Collections.Hashtable.generic_non_zero 1 [Error: Certificate has expired: Expired]'
"Description" : |
  The **mocctl** certificate expires if it's not used for more than 60 days. AKS hybrid uses the `mocctl` command-line tool to communicate with MocStack for performing Moc-related operations. The certificate that the `mocclt` command uses to communicate with cloudagent expires in 60 days. The `mocctl` command renews the certificate automatically when it's used close to its expiration (after ~42 days). If the command is not used frequently, the certificate expires.

  To reproduce the behavior, install AKS hybrid, and no operation involving the `mocctl` command is performed for 60 days.

"Fix" : |
  To fix the issue, log in again once the certificate expires. Execute the following PowerShell command to log in:

  ```powershell
  Repair-MocLogin
  ```
