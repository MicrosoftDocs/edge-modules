  During deployment, the error "No match was found for the specified search criteria for the provider **NuGet**" appears
"Description" : |
  This error appears when deploying through Windows Admin Center. The package provider requires the `PackageManagement` and `Provider` tags. You should check if the specified package has a tag error when attempting a deployment through Windows Admin Center. 

  This error comes from PowerShell and states that there are internet connectivity issues. PowerShell is trying to install the prerequisites package and is unable to install it. 
"Fix" : |
  Check to make sure the server or failover cluster has internet connectivity and then start a fresh installation.

  In Stage 2.1: System Validation, there may be an error when you hit install: `No match was found for the specified search criteria for the provider 'NuGet'. The package provider requires 'PackageManagement' and 'Provider' tags. Please check if the specified package has the tags.`
  Complete the PowerShell commands on the node(s) that you are trying to deploy to. You will have to manually install the NuGet using the following PowerShell command: 
  ```powershell
  Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force

  ```
  After running that command, close all open PowerShell windows and try again in Windows Admin Center.
