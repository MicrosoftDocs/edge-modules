  Set-AksHciConfig fails with error: “GetCatalog error returned by API call: … proxyconnect tcp: tls: first record does not look like a TLS Handshake"
"Description" : |
  If you are using AKS with a proxy server, you may have used the wrong URL when setting the required https proxy URL value.
"Fix" : |
  The http proxy URL and https proxy URL values are both required when configuring AKS with a proxy server, but it is common for both values to need to share the same http-prefixed URL.
  
  If this might be the case in your environment, try the following.
  
  1. Close the PowerShell window and open a new one
  2. Go through running New-AksHciNetworkSetting and New-AksHciProxySetting again, but when running New-AksHciProxySetting, set -https with the same http-prefixed URL value that you set for -http
  3. Run Set-AksHciConfig and proceed
