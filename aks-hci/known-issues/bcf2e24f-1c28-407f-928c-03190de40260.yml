  "Cluster IP Address x.x.x.x" fails
"Description" : |
  A cluster IP address shows as "Failed" during precheck. This precheck tests that all IPv4 addresses and DNS network names are online and reachable. For example, a failed IPv4 or network name can cause this test to fail.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this, perform the following steps:

  1. Run the following command:

     ```powershell
     Get-ClusterGroup -name "Cluster Group" | Get-ClusterResource
     ```

  1. Ensure that all network names and IP addresses are in an online state.
  1. Run the following two commands:
  
     ```powershell
     Stop-ClusterResource -name "Cluster IP Address x.x.x.x"
     ```

     and then
     
     ```powershell
     Start-ClusterResource -name "Cluster IP Address x.x.x.x"
     ```
