  When running Get-AksHciCluster, a "release version not found" error occurs
"Description" : |
  When running [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md) to verify the status of an AKS hybrid installation in Windows Admin Center, the output shows an error: "A release with version 1.0.3.10818 was NOT FOUND." However, when running [Get-AksHciVersion](./reference/ps/get-akshciversion.md), it showed the same version was installed. This error indicates that the build has expired. 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, run `Uninstall-AksHci`, and then run a new AKS hybrid build.
