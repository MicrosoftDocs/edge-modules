  Moc agent log rotation is failing.
"Description" : |
  Moc agents are expected to keep only the last 100 agent logs. They are supposed to delete the older logs. However, the log rotation is not happening and logs keep getting accumulated consuming disk space.

  To reproduce: `Install AksHci` and have a cluster up and running until the number of agent logs exceeds 100. At the time of the **nth** log creation, the agents are expected to delete the **n**-100th log, if they exist.
"Fix" : |
  To resolve the issue:

  1. Modify the cloud agent and node agents' logconf files.
    Cloud agent **logconfig** is located at:  
    `(Get-MocConfig).cloudConfigLocation+"\log\logconf"`.  
    Node agent **logconfig** is located at:  
    `(Get-MocConfig).cloudConfigLocation+"\log\logconf"`.  

  2. Change the value of **Limit** to 100 and Slots to 100 and save the configuration files.

  3. Restart the cloud agent and node agents to register these changes.

  These steps start the log rotation only after 100 new logs are generated from the agent restart. If there are already **n** agent logs at the time of restart, log rotation will start only after **n**+100 logs are generated.
