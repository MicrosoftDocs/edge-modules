  Certificate renewal pod is in a crash loop state
"Description" : |
  After upgrading or up-scaling the target cluster, the certificate renewal pod is now in a crash loop state. It's expecting a cert tattoo `yaml` file from the path `/etc/Kubernetes/pki`. The configuration file is present in the control plane node VMs but not on worker node VMs. 
"Fix" : |
  > [!NOTE]
  > This issue is fixed after the April 2022 release.

  To resolve this issue, manually copy the cert tattoo file from the control plane node to each of the worker nodes.

  1. Copy the file from control plane VM to your host machine current directory.

      ```bash
      ssh clouduser@<comtrol-plane-vm-ip> -i (get-mocconfig).sshprivatekey
      sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/pki/cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml ~/
      sudo chown clouduser cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml
      sudo chgrp clouduser cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml
      (change file permissions here so that scp will work)
      scp -i (get-mocconfig).sshprivatekey clouduser@<comtrol-plane-vm-ip>:~/cert*.yaml .\
      ```

  2. Copy the file from host machine to the worker node VM.

      ```bash
      scp -i (get-mocconfig).sshprivatekey .\cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml clouduser@<workernode-vm-ip>:~/cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml
      ```

  3. Set the owner and group information on this file back to root if it not already set to root.

      ```bash
      ssh clouduser@<workernode-vm-ip> -i (get-mocconfig).sshprivatekey
      sudo cp ~/cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml /etc/kubernetes/pki/cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml (copies the cert file to correct location)
      sudo chown root cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml
      sudo chgrp root cert-tattoo-kubelet.yaml
      ```

  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of your worker nodes.
