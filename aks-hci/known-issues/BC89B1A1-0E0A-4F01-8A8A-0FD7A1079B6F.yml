  Attempt to upgrade from the GA release to version 1.0.1.10628 is stuck at 'Update-KvaInternal'.
"Description" : |
  When attempting to upgrade AKS on Azure Stack HCI from the GA release to version 1.0.1.10628, if the `ClusterStatus` shows `OutOfPolicy`, you could be stuck at the _Update-KvaInternal_ stage of the upgrade installation. If you use the [repair-akshcicerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshcicerts.md) PowerShell cmdlet as a workaround, it also may not work. The AKS on Azure Stack HCI billing status must show as connected before upgrading. 
"Fix" : |
  An AKS on Azure Stack HCI upgrade is forward only and doesn't support version rollback, so if you get stuck, you can't upgrade.
