"Issue" : |
  Uninstall-AksHCI is not cleaning up cluster resources ('ownergroup ca-<GUID>').
"Description" : |
  Due to insufficient permissions in Active Directory, [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/uninstall-akshci.md) could not remove cluster resource objects in Active Directory, which can lead to failures in subsequent deployments. 
"Fix" : |
  To fix this issue, ensure that the user performing the installation has Full Control permissions to create/modify/remove Active Directory objects in the Active Directory container that the server and service objects are created in.
