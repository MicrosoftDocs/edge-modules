  I'm getting 'Install-AksHci Failed, Service returned an error. Status=403 Code="RequestDisallowedByPolicy"' error when installing AKS-HCI. What should I do?
"Description" : |
  This error may be caused by the installation process attempting to violate an Azure Policy that's been set on the Azure subscription or resource group provided during the Azure Arc onboarding process. This error may occur for users who have defined Azure Policies at a subscription or resource group level, and then attempt to install AKS on Azure Stack HCI which violates an Azure Policy. 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue, read the error message to understand which Azure Policy set by your Azure administrator has been violated, and then modify the Azure Policy by making an exception to the Azure Policy. To learn more about Policy exceptions, see [Azure Policy exemption structure](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure).
