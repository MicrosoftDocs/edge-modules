  Update of host OS HCI to HCIv2 breaks AKS on Azure Stack HCI installation: Cannot reach management cluster.
"Description" : |
  Running an OS update on a host with an AKS on Azure Stack HCI deployment can cause the deployment to enter a bad state, rendering the management cluster's API server unreachable and to fail day two operations. The `kube-vip` pod will not be able to apply VIP configuration to the interface, and as a result the VIP will be unreachable.

  To reproduce: Update a cluster with an existing AKS HCI deployment from HCI to HCIv2. Then try running commands that attempt to reach the management cluster such as `Get-AksHciCluster`. Any operations that attempt to reach the management cluster will fail with errors such as:

  ```powershell
  PS C:\Users\wolfpack> Get-AksHciCluster
  C:\Program Files\AksHci\kvactl.exe cluster list --kubeconfig="C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1\Msk8s\WorkingDir\1.0.8.10223\kubeconfig-mgmt" System.Collections.Hashtable.generic_non_zero 1 [Error: failed to connect to the cluster: action failed after 9
  attempts: Get "https://10.193.237.5:6443/api?timeout=10s": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection
  (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)]
  At C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Kva\1.0.22\Common.psm1:2164 char:9

  ``` 
"Fix" : |
  To resolve this issue: restart the `kube-vip` container to bring the deployment back to a good state.

  1. Get the `kube-vip` container ID:

    ```powershell  
    ssh -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip> "sudo crictl ls | grep 'kube-vip'"
    ```

    The output should look something like this, with the container ID being the first value `4a49a5158a5f8`. For example:
    ```powershell  
    4a49a5158a5f8       7751a28bb5ce1       28 minutes ago      Running             kube-vip                         1                   cf9681f921a55
    ```

  1. Restart the Restart the container:

    ```powershell  
    ssh -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip> "sudo crictl stop <Container ID>"
    ```
