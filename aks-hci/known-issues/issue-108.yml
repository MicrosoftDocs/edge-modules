## 108 The API server isn't responsive after several days
When attempting to bring up an AKS on Azure Stack HCI deployment after a few days, `Kubectl` didn't execute any of its commands. The Key Management Service (KMS) plug-in log displayed the error message `rpc error:code = Unauthenticated desc = Valid Token Required_. After running [Repair-AksHciCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshcicerts.md) to try to fix the issue, a different error appeared: _failed to repair cluster certificates`.

The [Repair-AksHciClusterCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshciclustercerts.md) cmdlet fails if the API server is down. If AKS on Azure Stack HCI hasn't been upgraded for 60 or more days, when you try to restart the KMS plug-in, it won't start. This failure also causes the API server to fail.

To fix this issue, you need to manually rotate the token and then restart the KMS plug-in and container to get the API server backup. To do this, run the following steps:

1. Rotate the token by running the following command:

   ```
   $ mocctl.exe security identity rotate --name "KMSPlugin-<cluster-name>-moc-kms-plugin" --encode=false --cloudFqdn (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.cloudfqdn > cloudlogin.yaml
   ```

2. Copy the token to the VM using the following command. The `ip` setting in the command below refers to the IP address of the AKS host's control plane.

   ```
   $ scp -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey .\cloudlogin.yaml clouduser@<ip>:~/cloudlogin.yaml $ ssh -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip> sudo mv cloudlogin.yaml /opt/wssd/k8s/cloudlogin.yaml
   ```

3. Restart the KMS plug-in and the container. 

   To get the container ID, run the following command:

   ```
   $ ssh -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip> "sudo docker container ls | grep 'kms'"
   ```

   The output should appear with the following fields:

   ```Output
   CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
   ``` 

   The output should look similar to this example:
   ```Output
   4169c10c9712 f111078dbbe1 "/kms-plugin" 22 minutes ago Up 22 minutes k8s_kms-plugin_kms-plugin-moc-lll6bm1plaa_kube-system_d4544572743e024431874e6ba7a9203b_1
   ```

4. Finally, restart the container by running the following command:

   ```
   $ ssh -i (Get-AksHciConfig).Moc.sshPrivateKey clouduser@<ip> "sudo docker container kill <Container ID>"
   ```
