  Applications that are NTP time-dependent trigger hundreds of false alerts
"Description" : |
  Applications that are NTP time-dependent can trigger hundreds of false alerts when they are out of time sync. If the cluster is running in a proxy environment, your nodepools may not be able to communicate with the default NTP server, **time.windows.com**, through your proxy or firewall.
"Fix" : |
  ### Fix

  To work around this issue, update the NTP server config on each nodepool node to synchronize the clocks. Doing so will set the clocks in each of your application pods as well.

  #### Prerequisites

  - An address of an NTP server that is accessible in each nodepool node.
  - Access to the workload cluster **kubeconfig** file.
  - Access to the management cluster **kubeconfig**.

  #### Steps

  1. Run the following `kubectl`` command using the workload cluster **kubeconfig** to get a list of nodes in it:

     ```powershell
     kubectl --kubeconfig <PATH TO KUBECONFIG> get nodes -owide
     ```

  1. Run the following `kubectl`` command to correlate the node names from the previous command to the workload cluster's nodepool nodes. Take note of the relevant IP addresses from the previous command's output.
  
     ```powershell
     kubectl --kubeconfig (Get-KvaConfig).kubeconfig get machine -l cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name=<WORKLOAD_CLUSTER_NAME>
     ```

  1. Using the output from the previous steps, run the following steps for each nodepool node that needs its NTP config updated:
     1. SSH into a nodepool node VM:
        
        ```powershell
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i (Get-MocConfig).sshPrivateKey clouduser@<NODEPOOL_IP>
        ```

     1. Verify that the configured NTP server is unreachable:

        ```shell
        sudo timedatectl timesync-status
        ```

        If the output looks like this, then the NTP server is unreachable and it needs to be changed:

        ```shell
        Server: n/a (time.windows.com)
        Poll interval: 0 (min: 32s; max 34min 8s)
        Packet count: 0
        ```

     1. To update the NTP server, run the following commands to set the NTP server in the timesync config file to one that is accessible from the nodepool VM:

        ```shell
        # make a backup of the config file
        sudo cp /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf ~/timesyncd.conf.bak
        
        # update the ntp server
        NTPSERVER="NEW_NTP_SERVER_ADDRESS"
        sudo sed -i -E "s|^(NTP=)(.*)$|\1$NTPSERVER|g" /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
        
        # verify that the NTP server is updated correctly - check the value for the field that starts with "NTP="
        sudo cat /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf 
        ```

     1. Restart the timesync service:

        ```shell
        sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
        ```

     1. Verify that the NTP server is accessible:

        ```shell
        sudo timedatectl timesync-status
        ```

     1. Verify that the clock shows the correct time:

        ```shell
        date
        ```

  1. Make sure that each nodepool node shows the same time by running the command from step 3.f.
  1. If your application does not update its time automatically, restart its pods.
